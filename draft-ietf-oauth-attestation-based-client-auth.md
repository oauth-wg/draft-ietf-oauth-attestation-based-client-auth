--- abstract

This specification defines a new method of client authentication for OAuth 2.0 {{RFC6749}} by extending the approach defined in {{RFC7521}}. This new method enables client deployments that are traditionally viewed as public clients to be able to authenticate with the authorization server through an attestation based authentication scheme.

# Introduction

{{RFC7521}} defines a way for a client to include an assertion in a token request to an authorization server for the purposes of client authentication. This specification uses this framework to define a new assertion type that provides a way for a client instance to authenticate itself with the authorization server through an assertion that is bound to a public key (for proof of possession). This assertion is designated with the name of Client Attestation in this draft.

The following diagram depicts the overall architecture and protocol flow.

The following steps describe this OAuth flow:

(1) The Client Instance generates a key (Client Instance Key) and optional further attestations (that are out of scope) to prove its authenticity to the Client Backend.

(2) The Client Instance sends this data to the Client Backend in request for a Client Attestation JWT.

(3) The Client Backend validates the Client Instance Key and optional further data. It generates a signed Client Attestation JWT that is cryptographically bound to the Client Instance Key generated by the Client. Therefore, the attestation is bound to this particular Client Instance.

(4) The Client Backend responds to the Client Instance by sending the Client Attestation JWT.

(5) The Client Instance generates a DPoP proof with the Client Instance Key.

(6) The Client Instance sends both the Client Attestation JWT and the DPoP proof to the authorization server, e.g. within a token request. The authorization server validates the Client Attestation and thus authenticates the Client Instance.

Note that the protocol for steps (2) and (4) and how the Client Instance authenticates to the Client Backend is out of scope of this specification.  Note also that this specification can be utilized without the client having a backend server at all; in this case, each client instance will perform the functions described as being done by the backend for itself.

# Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

# Terminology

Client Attestation JWT:
:  A JSON Web Token (JWT) generated by the client backend which is bound to a key managed by a client instance which can then be used by the instance for client authentication.

Client Instance Key:
:  A cryptographic, asymmetric key generated by the client instance and proven to the client backend. The public key is contained in the Client Attestation JWT and is used to sign the Client Attestation Proof of Possession.

# Client Authentication

To perform client authentication using this scheme, the client instance uses the following parameter values and encodings.

The value of the "client_assertion_type" parameter (as defined in {{RFC7521}}) set to "urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-client-attestation".

The value of the "client_assertion" parameter contains a single JWT known as the client attestation JWT as defined defined in [](#client-attestation-jwt). It MUST NOT contain more than one JWT.

The request MUST also contain a DPoP HTTP Header (as defined in section 4.1 of {{RFC9449}}).

The following example demonstrates client authentication using this scheme during the presentation of an authorization code grant in an access token request (with extra line breaks for display purposes only):

~~~

Host: as.example.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

## Request Processing Requirements {#request-processing-requirements}

In order to authenticate the client using this scheme, the authorization server MUST validate BOTH the Client Attestation JWT present in the "client_assertion" parameter and the DPoP HTTP header according to the criteria below.

It is RECOMMENDED that the authorization server validate the Client Attestation JWT prior to validating the DPoP HTTP header.

### Client Attestation JWT {#client-attestation-jwt}

The following rules apply to validating the client attestation JWT. Application of additional restrictions and policy are at the discretion of the authorization server.

1. The JWT MUST contain an "iss" (issuer) claim that contains a unique identifier for the entity that issued the JWT. In the absence of an application profile specifying otherwise, compliant applications MUST compare issuer values using the Simple String Comparison method defined in Section 6.2.1 of {{RFC3986}}.

2. The JWT MUST contain a "sub" (subject) claim with a value corresponding to the "client_id" of the OAuth client.

3. The JWT MUST contain an "exp" (expiration time) claim that limits the time window during which the JWT can be used.  The authorization server MUST reject any JWT with an expiration time that has passed, subject to allowable clock skew between systems.

4. The JWT MUST contain an "cnf" claim conforming {{RFC7800}} that conveys the key to be used for producing the DPoP HTTP header for client authentication with an authorization server. The key MUST be expressed using the "jwk" representation.

5. The JWT MAY contain an "nbf" (not before) claim that identifies the time before which the token MUST NOT be accepted for processing.

6. The JWT MAY contain an "iat" (issued at) claim that identifies the time at which the JWT was issued.

7. The JWT MAY contain other claims.

8. The JWT MUST be digitally signed using an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm. The authorization server MUST reject the JWT if it is using a Message Authentication Code (MAC) based algorithm. The authorization server MUST reject JWTs with an invalid signature.

9. The authorization server MUST reject a JWT that is not valid in all other respects per "JSON Web Token (JWT)" {{RFC7519}}.

The following example is the decoded header and payload of a JWT meeting the processing rules as defined above.

  "kid": "11"

  "iss": "https://client.example.com",
  "sub": "https://client.example.com",

    "jwk": {

      "y": "-V4dS4UaLMgP_4fY4j8ir7cl1TXlFdAgcx55o7TkcSA"
    }
  }
}
~~~

### DPoP HTTP header

The following rules apply to validating the DPoP HTTP header. Application of additional restrictions and policy are at the discretion of the authorization server.

1. The key represented in the JWK header parameter of the DPoP proof MUST match the key that is represented in the "cnf" claim of the Client Attestation JWT present in the "client_attestation" parameter.

2. The DPoP proof JWT present in the DPoP HTTP header MUST be valid in all other respects per hte processing rules defined in {{RFC9449}}.

# Implementation Considerations

## Reuse of a Client Attestation JWT

Implementers should be aware that the design of this authentication mechanism deliberately allows for a client instance to re-use a single Client Attestation JWT in multiple interactions/requests with an authorization server, whilst producing a fresh DPoP proof. Client deployments should consider this when determining the validity period for issued Client Attestation JWTs as this ultimately controls how long a client instance can re-use a single Client Attestation JWT.

## Refresh token binding

Authorization servers issuing a refresh token in response to a token request using the "urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-client-attestation" client authentication method MUST bind the refresh token to the client instance, and NOT just the client as specified in section 6 {{RFC6749}}. To prove this binding, the client instance MUST authenticate itself to the authorization server when refreshing an access token using the "urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-client-attestation" authentication method. The client MUST also use the same key that was present in the "cnf" claim of the client attestation that was used for client authentication when the refresh token was issued.

# Privacy Considerations

## Client Instance Tracking Across Authorization Servers

Implementers should be aware that using the same client attestation across multiple authorization servers could result in correlation of the end user using the client instance through claim values (including the public key in the `cnf` claim). Client deployments are therefore RECOMMENDED to use different client attestations across different authorization servers.

# Security Considerations

The guidance provided by {{RFC7519}} and {{RFC8725}} applies.

# Additional Examples

## Wallet Instance Attestation

This non-normative example shows a client attestations used as an wallet instance attestation in the context of eIDAS 2.0 {{ARF}}, e.g. to secure a Type-1 configuration credential. The additional claims describe the wallet's device binding und user binding capabilities and the achievable level of assurance.
